## Critical Rendering Path (CRP) Optimization

The Critical Rendering Path dictates how quickly the browser converts HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into painted pixels. 

### DOs
*   **DO inline critical CSS**: Extract styles necessary for above-the-fold content and inject them directly into the HTML `<head>`. Defer the rest of the stylesheet.
*   **DO use `async` or `defer` for all non-critical scripts**: Prevent JavaScript from blocking the DOM parser. Use `defer` for scripts that depend on the DOM or each other, and `async` for independent scripts. `type="module"` is preferred for modern JavaScript and is deferred by default so no need to have an explicit `defer` attribute but you can use `async` on independent module scripts.
*   **DO split CSS by media queries**: Use the `media` attribute on `<link>` tags so the browser downloads unused stylesheets (e.g., print styles or desktop styles on mobile) without blocking the render.
*   **DO utilize resource hints**: Add `preconnect` or `dns-prefetch` for essential third-party domains (e.g., font foundries or API endpoints) to establish early TLS handshakes.

### DON'Ts
*   **DON'T use `@import` in CSS**: This creates sequential request chains that delay the CSS Object Model (CSSOM) construction.
*   **DON'T place large, non-critical JavaScript in the `<head>`**: This halts DOM construction until the script is downloaded, parsed, and executed.
*   **DON'T load invisible or unreachable CSS/JS**: Ensure build tools apply tree-shaking and CSS minification to drop unreachable code before deployment.

### Code Examples

**HTML: Deferring Non-Critical CSS & Scripts**
```html
<!-- Inline critical styles directly in head -->
<style>
  body { margin: 0; font-family: system-ui; }
  .hero { min-height: 100vh; }
</style>

<!-- Defer non-critical CSS -->
<link rel="preload" href="non-critical.css" as="style" onload="this.onload=null;this.rel='stylesheet'">
<noscript><link rel="stylesheet" href="non-critical.css"></noscript>

<!-- Load CSS conditionally based on viewport -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="mobile.css" media="(max-width: 768px)">

<!-- Defer JavaScript execution -->
<script defer src="app-bundle.js"></script>
```

### The Resource Hint Navigator

| Hint | Tool Use Case | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `preconnect` | Resolve TLS/DNS for known third-party APIs | API endpoints, font services |
| `dns-prefetch` | Lean fallback for non-critical third-party origins | Ad servers, analytics fallbacks |
| `preload` | Same-origin asset needed *now* for rendering | Hero images, render-blocking fonts |
| `prefetch` | Assets needed for next-page navigation | Next-page bundle, detail views |

**Single-Sentence Mental Model**: "Preconnect for domains, Preload for viewport, Prefetch for futures."

## Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) & Resource Fetching

LCP measures the time required to render the largest visible text or image block within the viewport. Optimize LCP by prioritizing visible elements and prepolishing.

### DOs
*   **DO declare the LCP image in standard HTML**: Ensure LCP images are present in the raw HTML response so the preload scanner discovers it immediately. This can be be via an `<img>` element (preferred) or a `<link rel="preload" as="image">` (where the image resource is loaded due to JavaScript or CSS). Avoid relying on JavaScript or CSS to be the only source of the image resource.
*   **DO use `fetchpriority="high"` on the LCP images**: Images are not downloaded initially while the browser prioritizes render-blocking resources like CSS and JavaScript and can perform layout to discover if the images are in the viewport or not. Use `fetchpriority="high"` to signal to the browser's heuristic engine to start downloading the LCP image earlier. This should be on the `<img>` element (`<img fetchpriority="high">`) and any preload (`<link rel="preload" as="image" fetchpriority="high">`).
*   **DO use `fetchpriority="low"` to demote competing elements that are not in the initial viewport**: Lower the priority of large images or carousels that are *not* the primary LCP element and do *not* appear in the initial viewport, but may still be downloaded if near the viewport or hidden with CSS (for example `overflow:scroll` for carousels). Images with `fetchpriority="low"` will still be downloaded but start after higher-priority resources the browser has queued.
*   **DO use `loading="lazy"` to avoid loading competing elements that are far out of the initial viewport**: Images, iframes, and video and audio media which are well outside of the viewport should be lazy-loaded to avoid fetching these at all. Images with `loading="lazy"` will not be downloaded at all when well outside the viewport but will download when in, or near, the viewport (depending on browser heuristics and connection settings),.

### DON'Ts
*   **DON'T lazy-load the LCP image**: Never apply `loading="lazy"` to above-the-fold images. This purposefully delays the fetch until layout calculation is complete, severely degrading LCP.
*   **DON'T overuse `fetchpriority="high"`**: Prioritization is a zero-sum mechanism. Elevating too many resources creates network contention and negates the benefit.
*   **DON'T implement complex JavaScript loaders for the hero section**: Client-side rendering of the LCP element introduces substantial request chains (HTML -> JS -> Execution -> Image Request).

### Code Examples

**HTML: LCP Image Optimization**
```html
<!-- Standard LCP Image -->
<img 
  src="/images/hero.webp" 
  alt="Hero Product" 
  fetchpriority="high" 
  width="1200" 
  height="600"
>

<!-- Preloading a CSS-based LCP background -->
<link rel="preload" as="image" href="/images/bg-hero.webp" fetchpriority="high" type="image/webp">

<!-- Demoting an above-the-fold non-LCP carousel image -->
<img src="/images/carousel-2.webp" fetchpriority="low" loading="lazy" alt="Slide 2">
```

## Interaction to Next Paint (INP) & Main Thread Unblocking

INP measures the latency of all interactive events across the page's lifecycle. Poor INP is caused by long-running JavaScript tasks blocking the main thread. 

### DOs
*   **DO break up long tasks**: Any JavaScript execution exceeding 50ms should be split. Yield to the main thread frequently so the browser can process pending user inputs.
*   **DO use `scheduler.yield()` with a fallback**: Utilize the modern `scheduler.yield()` API to place task continuations at the *front* of the queue, falling back to `setTimeout` wrapped in a Promise for unsupported browsers.
*   **DO debounce or throttle rapid event listeners**: Limit the execution frequency of handlers attached to `scroll`, `resize`, or rapid `input` events.
*   **DO separate UI updates from heavy computations**: Update the UI synchronously to provide immediate visual feedback, then push background processing to a Web Worker or deferred task.

### DON'Ts
*   **DON'T rely solely on `setTimeout(..., 0)` for continuous yielding**: Standard `setTimeout` places continuations at the *back* of the task queue, potentially causing long delays if other tasks are pending. Use `scheduler.yield()` where available.
*   **DON'T cause layout thrashing**: Avoid interleaving DOM reads (`offsetHeight`, `getBoundingClientRect`) and writes (`style.height`) within the same loop. Batch DOM reads, then batch DOM writes.
*   **DON'T block the thread with recurring timers**: Avoid heavy polling with `setInterval` that starves the main thread.

### Code Examples

**JS: `scheduler.yield` Polyfill and Usage**
```javascript
// Polyfill for yielding to main thread
async function yieldToMain() {
  if ('scheduler' in window && 'yield' in scheduler) {
    return await scheduler.yield();
  }
  return new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 0));
}

// Processing a large array without blocking user input
async function processLargeList(items) {
  for (let i = 0; i < items.length; i++) {
    processItem(items[i]);
    
    // Yield every 50 iterations to allow rendering/interaction
    if (i % 50 === 0) {
      await yieldToMain();
    }
  }
}
```

### Main Thread Task Slicing Heuristic

**The 50ms Rule for INP**:
- **< 50ms**: Execute synchronously.
- **50ms - 250ms**: Slice tasks and yield with `scheduler.yield()`.
- **> 250ms**: Offload to a Web Worker.

## Third-Party Script Management

Third-party scripts (analytics, ads, chat widgets) are the primary source of main thread congestion.

### DOs
*   **DO avoid third-party scripts blocking main content**: Use `defer` with all third-party scripts unless critical to the page load and load them in the footer of the page, rather than the `<head>`.
*   **DO self-host critical third-party dependencies**: Reduce DNS lookups and enforce custom `Cache-Control` logic by hosting third-party libraries on the origin domain.

### Code Examples

**HTML: Third-Party Script Execution**
```html
<!-- 1. Place third-party scripts near the end of the page with the defer attribute -->
<script defer src="http://www.example.com/third-party.js"></script>
```

## CSS Rendering & Containment Optimization

Rendering involves Layout, Style, Paint, and Compositing calculations. CSS Containment limits the scope of these calculations which is useful on large, complex pages where such calculations can cause performance problems.

### DOs
*   **DO use `content-visibility: auto` on off-screen sections on large, complex pages**: Instruct the browser to skip layout and paint calculations for entire subtrees until they approach the viewport.
*   **DO pair `content-visibility` with `contain-intrinsic-size`**: Prevent layout shifts and scrollbar jumping by providing a placeholder height/width for unrendered containers.
*   **DO apply explicit CSS containment (`contain`)**: For isolated UI components (like modals or widgets), use `contain: layout style paint` to prevent internal changes from triggering page-wide reflows.

### DON'Ts
*   **DON'T apply `content-visibility: auto` on smaller, simpler pages**: The gains will be negligible and there are risks of side effects with content jumping.
*   **DON'T apply `content-visibility: auto` to above-the-fold content**: The browser will still evaluate it, but forcing it through the containment engine unnecessarily adds slight overhead to visible elements.
*   **DON'T overuse `will-change` globally**: Indiscriminately applying `will-change: transform` to multiple elements consumes excessive VRAM, causing GPU crashes or sluggish rendering.
*   **DON'T forget accessibility when hiding elements**: `content-visibility: auto` keeps elements in the DOM for screen readers. If content should be truly hidden from assistive technology when off-screen, manage `aria-hidden` attributes manually.

### Code Examples

**CSS: Content Visibility and Containment**
```css
/* Optimize a long list of articles below the fold */
.article-list-item {
  content-visibility: auto;
  contain-intrinsic-size: auto 600px; /* Provides a 600px placeholder */
}

/* Scope a complex widget to prevent layout thrashing */
.isolated-widget {
  contain: layout style paint;
}

/* Hardware accelerate an animation only on hover */
.interactive-button:hover {
  will-change: transform;
  transform: scale(1.05);
}
```

## Modern Image & Media Optimization

Images typically represent the largest payload on a given web page. Optimization requires format negotiation, responsive sizing, and layout stabilization.

### DOs
*   **DO serve modern formats (AVIF / WebP)**: Use the `<picture>` element to offer AVIF (best compression), falling back to WebP, and finally JPEG/PNG for legacy browsers.
*   **DO apply explicit `width` and `height` attributes**: Setting native attributes allows the browser to compute the aspect ratio immediately, reserving space and eliminating CLS. Image dimensions may be set either as HTML attributes or CSS properties.
*   **DO utilize `loading="lazy"` on all below-the-fold images**: Utilize native browser lazy loading to defer network requests for images outside the initial viewport.
*   **DO implement responsive images with `srcset` and `sizes`**: Serve tailored resolutions based on screen density and viewport width to prevent mobile devices from downloading desktop-sized images.

### DON'Ts
*   **DON'T lazy load above-the-fold images**: This directly harms LCP. Visible images must use `loading="eager"` (the default).
*   **DON'T delete necessary dimensions**: Failing to specify width/height on lazy loaded images causes layout shifts.
*   **DON'T omit the `sizes` attribute when using `srcset`**: Without `sizes`, the browser assumes `100vw` and downloads the largest available image.

### Code Examples

**HTML: Comprehensive Responsive Image Component**
```html
<picture>
  <!-- Modern Formats with Source Negotiation -->
  <source type="image/avif" srcset="hero-400w.avif 400w, hero-800w.avif 800w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 50vw">
  <source type="image/webp" srcset="hero-400w.webp 400w, hero-800w.webp 800w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 50vw">
  
  <!-- Fallback + Dimensions + Priority for Above-The-Fold -->
  <img 
    src="hero-800w.jpg" 
    alt="Descriptive text" 
    width="800" 
    height="600"
    fetchpriority="high"
    loading="eager"
  >
</picture>

<!-- Below-The-Fold Image -->
<img 
    src="footer-icon.png" 
    alt="Footer Logo" 
    width="100" 
    height="100"
    loading="lazy"
>

<!-- DO: Use native lazy loading for below the fold iframes -->
<iframe src="https://example.com/map" width="800" height="600" loading="lazy" title="Example Map"></iframe>
```

## Service Workers & Caching Strategies

Client-side caching via Service Workers allows applications to bypass the network entirely, serving resources from disk/memory.

### DOs
*   **DO use a `CacheFirst` strategy for static, versioned assets**: Immutable files (fonts, JS/CSS bundles with hash strings) should be served directly from the cache to guarantee instant loading.
*   **DO use `StaleWhileRevalidate` for dynamic, non-critical resources**: For API calls where slight staleness is acceptable, serve immediately from cache while silently updating the cache in the background.
*   **DO implement a `NetworkFirst` strategy for HTML documents**: Ensure the user always receives the latest application shell and manifest, falling back to cache only if offline.
*   **DO restrict cache sizes and expiry**: Use expiration plugins to prevent the Service Worker from exhausting the device's storage quota.

### DON'Ts
*   **DON'T cache opaque responses blindly**: Responses from third-party domains lacking CORS headers are "opaque". Caching them heavily consumes quota and fails silently. Only cache them using `NetworkFirst` or `StaleWhileRevalidate`.
*   **DON'T cache POST requests**: Service workers cannot cache non-GET requests natively. Implement background sync queues for offline submissions.
*   **DON'T bypass versioning**: Failing to update asset hashes/versions will trap users in infinite cache loops.

### Code Examples

**JS: Service Worker Caching via Workbox**
```javascript
import { registerRoute } from 'workbox-routing';
import { CacheFirst, StaleWhileRevalidate, NetworkFirst } from 'workbox-strategies';
import { ExpirationPlugin } from 'workbox-expiration';
import { CacheableResponsePlugin } from 'workbox-cacheable-response';

// 1. HTML Documents: Network First
registerRoute(
  ({ request }) => request.mode === 'navigate',
  new NetworkFirst({ cacheName: 'pages-cache' })
);

// 2. Static Assets (JS, CSS, Fonts): Cache First
registerRoute(
  ({ request }) => ['style', 'script', 'font'].includes(request.destination),
  new CacheFirst({
    cacheName: 'static-resources',
    plugins: [
      new CacheableResponsePlugin({ statuses: [0, 200] }),
      new ExpirationPlugin({ maxEntries: 50, maxAgeSeconds: 30 * 24 * 60 * 60 })
    ]
  })
);

// 3. API Responses: Stale While Revalidate
registerRoute(
  ({ url }) => url.pathname.startsWith('/api/v1/content'),
  new StaleWhileRevalidate({
    cacheName: 'api-cache',
    plugins: [
      new CacheableResponsePlugin({ statuses: [0, 200] })
    ]
  })
);
```

## Web Fonts Optimization

Web fonts are a common source of render blocking. Optimizing them reduces the Flash of Invisible Text (FOIT) and speeds up initial rendering.

### DOs
*   **DO preload critical fonts**: Use `<link rel="preload" as="font" type="font/woff2" crossorigin>` for fonts seen above the fold. Do include the `crossorigin` attribute for all fonts (even same origin fonts).
*   **DO subset fonts**: Trim font weights and glyph variations to include only the characters your application requires.

### DON'Ts
*   **DON'T preload all fonts**: Over-preloading leads to network contention that starves other critical assets.
*   **DON'T use `fetchpriority="high"` on fonts**: Fonts are loaded with a high priority by default so there is no need to specify `fetchpriority="high"`.

### Code Examples

**CSS: Font Loading Face**
```css
@font-face {
  font-family: 'Modern Sans';
  src: url('/fonts/modern-sans.woff2') format('woff2');
}
```

**HTML: Critical Font Preload**
```html
<!-- Always use crossorigin for fonts even if on the same origin -->
<link rel="preload" href="/fonts/modern-sans.woff2" as="font" type="font/woff2" crossorigin>
```

## Video Performance & Metrics

Video payloads are among the heaviest assets. Optimization focuses on reducing bandwidth stall and preserving Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) stability.

### DOs
*   **DO specify explicit `width` and `height` attributes**: Setting native dimensions reserves layout space and prevents CLS.
*   **DO provide a `poster` image fallback**: Display a lightweight image placeholder while the video buffers to improve perceived performance.
*   **DO use `<link rel="preload" as="image" fetchpriority="high">` for poster images where the video is the LCP element**: This ensures the image is downloaded as quickly as possible.
*   **DO use `preload="none"` for non-critical videos**: Delay bandwidth consumption for below-the-fold or non-autoplaying videos.
*   **DO serve modern formats via source negotiation**: Offer WebM (better compression ratio) alongside standard MP4 formats.
*   **DO use `loading="lazy"` for offscreen videos**: Lazy-loading videos allow `poster` and `preload` downloads to be deferred until the video is in or near the viewport.

### DON'Ts
*   **DON'T auto-play video files blindly**: Rely on user intent or use progressive enhancement streams.
*   **DON'T auto-play large video files at all**: Rely on user intent before downloading large files.

### Code Examples

**HTML: Accessible and Dynamic Video Loader**
```html
<video 
  controls 
  width="1200" 
  height="675"
  poster="/images/video-poster.webp" 
  preload="none"
  loading="lazy"
>
  <source src="/videos/intro.webm" type="video/webm">
  <source src="/videos/intro.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  <!-- Include accessibility tracks -->
  <track src="/video-caps.vtt" kind="captions" srclang="en" label="English">
</video>
```

## JavaScript Code-Splitting

Heavy monolithic bundles block main thread parse times on low-end devices. Splitting ensures we only download bytes required for the immediate viewport.

### DOs
*   **DO use dynamic imports**: Split routes or heavy UI libraries using standard `import()` specifications.
*   **DO configure bundler asset chunking**: Use Vite or Webpack rollup directives to split third-party vendors from runtime application logic.

### DON'Ts
*   **DON'T ship a single, enormous `app.js` bundle**: It increases parse time and memory consumption for initial views.

### Code Examples

**JS: Route based Dynamic Splitting**
```javascript
// Dynamic import of heavy module only when button is clicked
document.getElementById('heavy-btn').addEventListener('click', async () => {
  const { heavyFunction } = await import('./heavy-module.js');
  heavyFunction();
});
```

## 1. Fundamental Semantics and Validation

### Guidelines

- **DO** use the standard HTML5 doctype `<!DOCTYPE html>` to prevent quirky rendering modes. 
- **DO** set the `lang` attribute on the `<html>` element for screen reader pronunciation and translation tools.
- **DO** use the `<meta name="viewport">` element with the `content` attribute set to `"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"` to ensure page responsiveness.
- **DO** use a single `<h1>` per page/view representing the main topic. Exceptions can be made for modal dialogs, which can also use a single `<h1>`.
- **DO** maintain a sequential, non-skipping heading hierarchy (`<h2>` to `<h3>`, but not `<h2>` to `<h4>`).
- **DO** use semantic landmarks (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<aside>`, `<footer>`) to create regional navigation for assistive technologies.
- **DO** use `<search>` to enclose search and filtering mechanisms (eliminates the need for `role="search"`).
- **DO** use `<button>` for triggered actions (JS, Modals, Forms) and `<a>` strictly for URL navigation. Set `type="button"` for non-submit buttons in forms to prevent unintended submission.
- **DO** use `<ul>`, `<ol>`, and `<dl>` elements for list content. 
- **DO** ensure that all interactive elements like links and buttons have accessible names.  
- **DO** hide purely decorative SVG images from assistive technology using `aria-hidden="true"`. If using a decorative `<img>`, always include an empty `alt` attribute (e.g. `alt=""`). 
- **DO** ensure that informative SVGs like logos, data visualizations, or icon buttons have a proper accessible name. 

- **DON'T** use generic `<div>` or `<span>` when semantic elements exist, for instance for interactive elements, headings, or independently reusable self-contained content.
- **DON'T** use boolean attributes with redundant values (e.g., use `disabled`, not `disabled="disabled"`).
- **DON'T** use generic elements with added ARIA roles or states when native elements with built-in semantics and behavior exist.
- **DON'T** change the native semantics of elements with ARIA unless it is a critical requirement. 
- **DON'T** use `role="presentation"` or `aria-hidden="true"` on focusable elements or their parents and ancestors. 
- **DON'T** disable page zooming capabilities.

### Code Example

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Dashboard | Platform</title>
</head>
<body>
  <header>
    <nav>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="#">About</a></li>
        <li><a href="#">Contact</a></li>
      </ul>
    </nav>
  </header>
  <main>
     <h1>Analytics</h1>
    <search>
      <form action="/filter" method="GET">
        <label for="search-input">Scan items:</label>
        <input type="search" id="search-input" name="q">
        <button type="submit">Search</button>
      </form>
    </search>
    <article>
      <h2>First post</h2>
    </article>
  </main>
</body>
</html>
```

## 2. Content Grouping and Attribution

### Guidelines

- **DO** use `<blockquote>` for extended quotations from another source, and use the `cite` attribute to provide a machine-readable URL for that source.
- **DO** use `<figure>` to group self-contained content (images, code snippets, or quotes) that is referenced from the main flow but could be moved to an appendix or sidebar without affecting the document's meaning.
- **DO** use `<figcaption>` as the first or last child of a `<figure>` to provide a human-readable caption or attribution.
- **DO** use the `<cite>` element inside a caption or attribution to identify the **title** of a work (e.g., a book or website name), not the author's name.
- **DO** use the `<code>` element for short fragments of computer code (e.g., variable names, file paths, or inline snippets).
- **DO** wrap `<code>` inside a `<pre>` element when displaying blocks of code to preserve whitespace and line breaks.
- **DO** ensure that code blocks are accessible by adding `tabindex="0"` to the `<pre>` element if it becomes scrollable, allowing keyboard users to reach the content.

- **DON'T** use `<blockquote>` for purely visual indentation of non-quoted text.
- **DON'T** use `<figure>` for every single image; use it only when a caption is required or when the content is a distinct, referenced unit.
- **DON'T** use `<pre>` without `<code>` for code blocks; `<pre>` alone only preserves formatting but doesn't convey that the content is a computer language.

### Code Example

```html
<!-- Quote with attribution using Figure -->
<figure>
  <blockquote cite="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/">
    <p>The figure element represents some flow content, optionally with a caption, that is self-contained and is typically referenced as a single unit from the main flow of the document.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <figcaption>
    Definition of the &lt;figure&gt; element from the <cite>HTML Living Standard</cite>
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<!-- Image with caption -->
<figure>
  <img 
    src="architecture-diagram.webp" 
    alt="Diagram showing the flow between Client, API Gateway, and Microservices"
    width="800"
    height="450"
    loading="lazy"
  >
  <figcaption>Figure 1: High-level system architecture overview.</figcaption>
</figure>

<!-- Code block with accessibility and language hint -->
<figure>
  <figcaption>Example configuration:</figcaption>
  <pre tabindex="0"><code class="language-json">
{
  "name": "gemini-cli",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "private": true
}
  </code></pre>
</figure>

<!-- Inline code -->
<p>To initialize the project, run the <code>npm install</code> command.</p>
```

## 3. Resource Prioritization and Performance

### Guidelines

- **DO** use `fetchpriority="high"` for the Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) element (e.g., hero image) to elevate network priority.
- **DO** use `<link rel="preload" as="image">` with `fetchpriority="high"` for LCP background images defined in CSS.
- **DO** apply `loading="lazy"` to off-screen images and iframes to defer bandwidth.
- **DO** specify `width` and `height` on all `<img>` tags to preserve aspect ratio and prevent Layout Shifts (CLS).
- **DO** use the `srcset` attribute on `<img>`s for adding multiple versions of the same image at different sizes.
- **DO** use the `<picture>` element with a fallback `<img>` for more fine-grained image control like switching between image formats, image sizes, and cropping images at different device sizes. 

- **DON'T** apply `loading="lazy"` to above-the-fold or hero images. This delays LCP.
- **DON'T** overuse `fetchpriority="high"`; prioritization is a zero-sum mechanism. Use `fetchpriority="low"` to demote non-critical trackers or later carousel items.

### Code Example

```html
<!-- High-priority hero image with responsive sizes -->
<img 
  src="hero-large.webp" 
  srcset="hero-small.webp 480w, hero-medium.webp 800w, hero-large.webp 1200w"
  sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, (max-width: 1200px) 80vw, 70vw"
  alt="Main product view" 
  fetchpriority="high" 
  width="1200" 
  height="600"
>

<!-- Art direction and format switching with <picture> -->
<picture>
  <!-- Mobile Art Direction: Different aspect ratio (square) and format (AVIF) -->
  <source 
    media="(max-width: 600px)" 
    srcset="hero-mobile.avif 1x, hero-mobile-2x.avif 2x" 
    type="image/avif"
    width="600" 
    height="600"
  >
  <source 
    media="(max-width: 600px)" 
    srcset="hero-mobile.webp 1x, hero-mobile-2x.webp 2x"
    width="600" 
    height="600"
  >
  
  <!-- Desktop: Modern format for primary layout -->
  <source srcset="hero-desktop.avif" type="image/avif">

  <!-- Fallback img defines the default aspect ratio (2:1) -->
  <img 
    src="hero-desktop.webp" 
    alt="Platform dashboard overview" 
    width="1200" 
    height="600"
    loading="lazy"
  >
</picture>

<!-- Low-priority decorative footer image -->
<img 
  src="footer-art.png" 
  alt="" 
  loading="lazy" 
  width="200" 
  height="100"
>
```

## 4. Native Overlays: Dialogs and Popovers

### Guidelines

See `declarative-dialog-popover-control` (via `npx -y modern-web-guidance@latest retrieve "declarative-dialog-popover-control"`) for more info on fallback strategies for using the Popover API in a cross-browser way.
- **DO** use `<dialog>` for modal overlays (requires JS `.showModal()`) to automatically trap focus, dim backgrounds, and support dismissing via `Esc`. Use the `closedby="any"` attribute to enable native "light-dismiss" (closing on backdrop click) without custom JavaScript.
- **DO** utilize the Popover API (`popover` attribute) for non-modal UI (menus, tooltips) that do not require focus traps.
- **DO** use `::backdrop` to style modal backgrounds.
- **DO** use `<form method="dialog">` to dismiss dialogs without manual JS handlers. Combined button `formmethod="dialog"` yields the button's value to the dialog `.returnValue`.

- **DON'T** use `show()` for modals where keyboard traps are expected (use `showModal()`).
- **DON'T** call `showModal()` on elements possessing a `popover` attribute (they are mutually exclusive programmatic states). However, `<dialog popover="auto">` is a valid declarative architecture to combine dialog semantics with light-dismiss mechanics.

### Code Example

```html
<!-- Popover (No JS required for toggle) -->
<button popovertarget="help-menu">Info</button>
<div id="help-menu" popover="auto">
  <p>Standard help text.</p>
</div>

<!-- Modal Dialog with Form-based closing -->
<button id="show-dialog">Open dialog</button>
<dialog id="fav-modal">
  <!-- method="dialog" closes the dialog natively and sets the returnValue -->
  <form method="dialog">
    <p>Confirm action?</p>
    <button value="cancel">Cancel</button>
    <button value="confirm">Confirm</button>
  </form>
</dialog>

<script>
  const dialog = document.getElementById("fav-modal");
  const openModal = document.getElementById("show-dialog");
  
  // Show modal dialog
  openModal.addEventListener('click', () => dialog.showModal());
  
  // Listen for the 'close' event to retrieve the user's choice (returnValue)
  dialog.addEventListener('close', () => {
    console.log(dialog.returnValue); // "confirm" or "cancel"
  });
</script>
```

### Native UI Overlay & Disclosure Matrix

| Feature | Modality | Focus | Dismiss Mechanism | Use Case |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`<dialog>`** | Modal / Non-modal | Automatic trap (Modal) | Esc / Form / `closedby` | Critical Actions, Settings |
| **`[popover]`** | Non-modal | Standard Tab flow | Light-dismiss (Click outside) | Menus, Tooltips, Toasts |
| **`<details>`** | Inline Disclosure | Standard Tab flow | Toggle summary | Accordions, FAQs |

**Heuristic Rule**: Use `<dialog>` for interruptions requiring user action, `popover` for transient info, and `<details>` for inline content expansion.

## 5. Disclosures: Details and Summary

### Guidelines

- **DO** use `<details>` and `<summary>` for native accordions or revealable content without JS.
- **DO** place `<summary>` as the *first* child of `<details>`.
- If headings must be used within a `<summary>`, consider if the heading is essential for understanding or navigating the document structure. If it is, use a more robust disclosure approach that allows wrapping the disclosure trigger with the heading (e.g. `<h2><button type="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="significant-section-content">Significant section</button></h2>`). This ensures the heading semantics aren’t lost, and the button and its state are announced.
- **DO** use `details[open]` attribute for styling expanded states.
- **DO** use `details::details-content` for styling the contents of the `<details>` element.
- **DO** use the `name` attribute on multiple `<details>` elements to create exclusive accordions (opening one closes others).

- **DON'T** nest other interactive elements (links, buttons) directly inside `<summary>` text as it acts as a button and breaks focus.
- **DON'T** hide visible triangles via `list-style: none` without providing explicit directional cues (via `::before`/`::after` pseudo-elements).
- **DON'T** use the `title` attribute to create tooltip effects. 

### Code Example

```html
<!-- Exclusive Accordion Set -->
<details name="faq">
  <summary>Item 1</summary>
  <p>Contents...</p>
</details>
<details name="faq">
  <summary>Item 2</summary>
  <p>Contents...</p>
</details>
```

## 6. Focus Boundaries and Visibility

### Guidelines

- **DO** use the global `inert` attribute for entire hidden sections (off-screen menus, background while custom modal is open) to remove them from tab flows and accessibility trees.
- **DO** pair `[inert]` with CSS (`opacity: 0.5`) to visually signify inactivity.
- **DO** rely on natural DOM order for sequential navigation. 

- **DON'T** use positive `tabindex` values (e.g., `1`, `2`). Use `0` to add element to tab flow, or `-1` for JS program focus.
- **DON'T** alter focus flow using CSS properties (`flex-flow: row-reverse`, `order`) without aligning the DOM structure.
- **DON'T** use `node.focus({ preventScroll: true })` without usability validation; it can hide the focused element off-screen.

### Code Example

```html
<!-- De-tabbing a background app shell while custom drawer is open -->
<main id="app-shell" inert>
  <a href="/">Dashboard</a>
</main>
<aside id="drawer">
  <button>Close</button>
</aside>
```

```css
[inert], [inert] * {
  opacity: 0.5;
  cursor: default;
  user-select: none;
}
```

## 7. HTML APIs and Forms Grouping

### Guidelines

See `forms` (via `npx -y modern-web-guidance@latest retrieve "forms"`) for more details on creating modern web forms.

- **DO** utilize the `form="form-id"` attribute to decouple inputs from the physical `<form>` tree.
- **DO** use `<datalist>` coupled with `<input list="id">` for lightweight auto-suggestions (note: visually unstylable and has screen-reader quirks). 
- **DON'T** use `autocomplete="off"` on credential, address, payment, or contact fields. Browsers and password managers ignore it there by design. Use a specific token instead (`autocomplete="email"`, `"street-address"`, `"cc-number"`, etc.).
- **DON'T** use `autocomplete="off"` unless handling highly sensitive tracking tokens (violates standard password manager overrides). Use standard inputs `type="email"`, `type="tel"`.
- **DO** distinguish `autocomplete="current-password"` (sign-in) from `autocomplete="new-password"` (registration / password change) so password managers offer the right action.                                                    
- **DO** match `autocomplete` tokens with appropriate `inputmode` and `type` (`type="email"` + `inputmode="email"` + `autocomplete="email"`). They control different things — keyboard, validation, and autofill respectively — and reinforce each other.

### Code Example

```html
<form>
  <fieldset>
    <legend>Address Information</legend>
    <label for="city">City:</label>
    <input type="text" id="city" list="cities" autocomplete="address-level2">
    <datalist id="cities">
      <option value="New York">
      <option value="London">
    </datalist>
  </fieldset>
</form>
```

## 8. Native Media Elements

### Guidelines

- **DO** set `width` and `height` to prevent layout shifts (CLS) on `<video>` elements.
- **DO** provide a `poster` image fallback for videos.
- **DO** include subtitles and captions with `<track>`.
- **DO** ensure background videos are `muted`, provide users with full control over playback, and use `role="none"` or `aria-hidden="true"`. The `controls` attribute must also be omitted to make sure the video is not focusable.  

- **DON'T** rely on JS for basic video controls if native `controls` attribute is sufficient.
- **DON'T** apply `role="none"` or `aria-hidden="true"` to focusable elements (such as embedded interactive `<iframe>` components). Hiding elements from the assistive technology tree while leaving them accessible to sequential keyboard navigation violates core accessibility heuristics. The background video exception holds solely because omitting the `controls` attribute renders the `<video>` element fully non-focusable.

### Code Example

```html
<video 
  controls 
  width="800" 
  height="450" 
  poster="poster.webp"
>
  <source src="intro.webm" type="video/webm">
  <source src="intro.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  <track src="caps.vtt" kind="captions" srclang="en" label="English">
</video>
```

## 9. Dynamic Styles and Interactivity

### Guidelines
- **DO** use the `style` attribute to pass state to CSS via **Custom Properties**. This keeps visual logic in your stylesheet while JavaScript provides the raw data.

- **DON'T** use inline styles for static design (colors, padding, margins) that belong in a stylesheet.
- **DON'T** use inline event handlers (e.g., `onclick`). Trigger actions using `addEventListener()`.

### Code Example

```html
<body>
  <!-- Progress with style-driven color data -->
  <label for="upload-progress">Upload status:</label>
  <progress id="upload-progress" class="loading-bar" value="0" max="100" style="--brand-hue: 200;"></progress>

  <script>
    const updateProgress = (percent, hue) => {
      const bar = document.querySelector('.loading-bar');
      bar.value = percent;
      
      // Update dynamic style variable 
      if (hue) bar.style.setProperty('--brand-hue', hue);
    };

    // Example: Move to 85% and shift color to green (120)
    setTimeout(() => updateProgress(85, 120), 1000);
  </script>
</body>
```
```css
.loading-bar {
  accent-color: hsl(var(--brand-hue, 200) 80% 50%);
  transition: accent-color 0.3s ease;
}
```
